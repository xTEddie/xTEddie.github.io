In Fall 2018, I am going to my final year in software engineering at Concordia University. I am a hackathon enthusiast and helped my university to organize our hackathon [ConUHacks](https://conuhacks.io/) two years in a row. I've been learning a lot of cool and fun materials related to programming and I would like share everything on this blog that I built.

Thanks for reading!
